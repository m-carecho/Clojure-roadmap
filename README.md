# Clojure Roadmap for Beginners to Advanced Programmers
This is a Clojure roadmap that I have created based on my personal experience learning Clojure and functional programming. 
This roadmap is structured for beginners and advanced users alike and aims to provide a step-by-step guide to mastering Clojure. 
Please note **that this roadmap does not include information on setting up Clojure or its SDK**. You can find a lot of information on that topic by searching for videos or articles.
